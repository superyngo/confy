## Architecture

**Lossless CST.** `CstDocument` (`model/cst_doc.rs`) holds a `taplo` parse → `rowan` syntax tree
as the single source of truth. Comments, whitespace and newlines are real tokens with real
positions, so `serialize()` is plain token concatenation and an untouched file round-trips
byte-identically. The Node tree is a *projection* (`cst_project.rs`) rebuilt after every
mutation — it is never mutated directly. `apply` edits a `clone_for_update` copy of the tree and
commits only on success, so **every mutation is atomic** (failure leaves the document untouched).
Every successful mutation is also **semantically validated before commit** (`validate_semantics`:
taplo DOM validation — duplicate sections/keys reject as `Collision`, other semantic errors as
`Illegal`), a backstop for edits the targeted pre-checks can't see (e.g. a whole-document or block
`$EDITOR` rewrite introducing a duplicate `[a]`).

**`ConfigDocument` trait** abstracts the storage backend so YAML/JSON can be added later; the
only backend is `CstDocument` (the original `toml_edit`-based `TomlDocument` was retired after
reaching parity). The trait exposes `load`, `project`, `serialize`, `serialize_fragment`,
`is_dirty`, and `apply(Mutation)`.

**Addressing.** Keyed nodes are addressed by `Seg::Key(name)`; **positional** nodes — comments,
array elements, AoT entries — by `Seg::Index(i)` over the parent's *full child sequence*
(comments share the slot space, so an element after a comment keeps its full-sequence index).
There are no synthetic keys; the TUI identifies a comment by `NodeKind::Comment`, never by
sniffing the path. `cst_edit::walk` builds the same `path → syntax element` index the projection
uses, so resolver and projection cannot drift (a consistency test ties them).

**`Mutation` enum** is the closed set of document operations (Insert, Delete, Replace, Rename,
Move, Remark, EditComment, InsertComment). Each variant is implemented in `cst_edit.rs` as a
rowan green-tree splice (insert/remove/replace of syntax elements with newline/indent
normalization). `Rename` swaps only the key token in place (position-preserving,
collision-checked) — there is no separate user-facing rename action; it is driven from the
inline editor (see below). `Replace` with an **empty path** targets the whole document (external
`E` on the root/file node): it reparses the edited text as a full document, rejecting invalid
TOML as `Fragment` (doc untouched). `Replace` on an AoT-entry path (`product[0]`) rewrites only
that `[[product]]` entry; sibling entries and between-entry comments stay intact. `Insert`
adapts the fragment to the destination (`parse_fragment_adapted`): a **keyless** bare value dropped
into an array becomes the element as-is while a **keyed** fragment is wrapped as a `{ key = value }`
inline-table element to preserve its key (a keyed inline table nests; `wrap_keyed_as_inline_element`),
a bare value inserted into a table gets a synthesized
`placeholder` key (auto-renamed on collision), and a `[table]`/`[[aot]]` fragment cannot become an array
element (rejected as `Illegal`); a header-vs-leaf **partition check** keeps an insert from being captured by a following
`[table]` header — for a *table* destination the index is **clamped to the nearest legal slot**
(an entry lands at the end of the entry run, a section at the start of the section run), so the
paste "Into" slot (append) never fails on position; only a Root-level out-of-partition insert
still reports `Illegal`. Inserting a keyed entry **into an inline table** routes to `inline_table_insert`,
which rebuilds the `{ … }` from its members' verbatim source with normalized `, ` separators
(taplo bakes the closing brace's leading space into the last entry, so token surgery is brittle) —
the new entry lands at the target slot (front/middle/append), a duplicate key is a `Collision`, and
an empty `{}` becomes `{ k = v }`. **`[A/T]` interactions**: inserting keyed
fragments into an AoT *group* synthesizes a new `[[…]]` entry at the target slot
(`aot_group_insert`; multiple pasted nodes are joined — `joinable_entry` — and pack into ONE
entry; in-set duplicate keys follow o/r/c; a section fragment is `Illegal`). An `[A/T]` group is
**equivalent to an array of inline tables**: moving/copying an AoT *entry* out **splits it into
member fragments** (`aot_entry_member_fragments` — body entry lines verbatim, one fragment each,
**sub-sections flattened to dotted entries**: `[fruit.physical]` `color` → `physical.color`), so
into a table/root the members land as nodes (dotted re-prefix, per-leaf collision) and into
another group / an array they join into ONE `[[entry]]` / `{ … }` element. Deleting an entry
removes its **full extent** (`aot_entry_end`: own section + its sub-sections). A nested `[[…]]`
sub-group has no dotted form — move degrades to `Unsupported`, copy falls back to the full
section capture. Known edges: whole-AoT-*group* Move degrades to a graceful
`Unsupported`, and multiline-array element insert/delete spacing is not yet byte-perfect.

**Projection.** Dotted *keys* (`a.b.c = 1`) **nest** into a chain of synthetic `Table` nodes
(`a → b → c`) with `Format::Dotted` (rendered `[T/D]`) — `project_entry_into`/`ensure_dotted_chain`
in `cst_project.rs`; scattered dotted entries sharing a prefix merge under one table **per scope**,
positioned at the table's **first** definition (matching where a consolidating block-rewrite
lands). The leaf keeps the **full** path for its
`Target::Entry`, so an **untouched file round-trips byte-identically**; the synthetic intermediates
carry no index target (like an implicit header table — the `index_covers_every_projected_path` test
exempts `Table` nodes), and — like every other branch — **start collapsed** (only the root file node
is seeded into `expanded` at load). The whole
decomposed chain (synthetic tables **and** leaf) carries `KeySign::Dotted` (`(D)`) — `(D)` marks
any dotted-key origin, so the `f` filter's `(D)` checkbox matches decomposed dotted entries;
per-segment `Bare`/`Quoted` is no longer surfaced for a decomposed chain. A dotted key **inside an
inline table** (`t = { x.y = 1, x.z = 2 }`) decomposes the same way — members sharing a prefix
merge under one synthetic `[T/D]` chain inside the `[T/I]` node. Ops on such a synthetic table
route through the **inline machinery**, never the flat-ROOT splices (`inline_ancestor_len` guards
the path): insert/add re-prefixes the key scope-relative (`q = 9` into `t.x` → member `x.q = 9`)
and lands via `inline_table_insert` with the projected index translated to a raw member slot
(`inline_raw_member_index`); collision is exact full path (a shared prefix merges); `Delete` and
move/copy fan out over the member entries (`inline_member_entries`; capture drops the segments
between the `{ … }` and the node, keeping its own key); the `e` block edit consolidates at the
first member (`replace_inline_dotted_table`, single-line entries only); comments are rejected
(`{ … }` holds none). **Comments are never inside a `[T/D]` table**: a comment adjacent to a
dotted member is an independent scope-level node (it stays put on table move/copy/delete and
the `e` consolidation), and `InsertComment` targeting a `[T/D]` re-routes to the scope level —
the comment lands directly **above the table's first member** as an independent node, never
rejected, never bound. **Editing a `[T/D]` table**
(`cst_edit.rs`, all keyed off `Format::Dotted` since the table has no own element): a child
insert/add writes a scope-relative dotted entry next to its siblings (`x = v` → `a.b.x = v`,
`prefix_entry_key`); a child `add` seeds a scalar (a dotted table is excluded from the
table-capture **partition split** in `add_node`/`check_partition`, so a following scalar is legal);
`Replace` (the `e` block edit) **consolidates** — `replace_dotted_table` removes every member
(`dotted_member_entries`) and splices the edited block in at the first member's slot; `Delete` fans
out to remove every member (plain cascade). `dotted_member_entries` counts only **flat-ROOT**
entries — an entry nested inside an inline-table/array *value* (`dotted.t = {x=1}`) belongs to that
value, not the table, so its interior is never pulled out as a stray top-level line. `Rename` rewrites the **whole** key (not just the last
segment), so `foo` → `foo.x` turns a scalar into a `[T/D]` table — the inline editor confirms the
type change and defers the whole edit (`PendingCommit::Rename`) so `n` is a no-op. A whole-subtree
*move/copy* of a synthetic `[T/D]` table **fans out to its member entries** (`move_nodes` and the
header-less multi-entry `insert` split), each captured scope-relative and re-prefixed for the
destination — so cut/copy of a `[T/D]` table into a scope / another `[T/D]` / root adjusts the prefix.
Insert **collision is exact full-path** (`target.parent ++ key segments`): a dotted sibling sharing only
a prefix merges into the same table instead of colliding. **Every table is an open set of "member
spans"** (`table_member_spans` in `cst_edit.rs`): its own `[a]` section, every descendant
`[a.sub]`/`[[a.list]]` section wherever it sits, plus flat dotted member lines — serialize/`e`,
delete and move/copy fan out over all of them, so a scattered `[a] … [b] … [a.sub]` is captured,
deleted and moved whole (no orphan `[a.sub]`), the block edit consolidating at the **first
definition** (validated when 2+ spans: headers must stay in-subtree and the block header-led — see
CONTEXT.md's `e` matrix). An **implicit** table (only `[a.sub]` written) gets its `[a]` section
synthesized at first definition when an entry child is inserted; a **mixed** table (dotted members
+ sections, the `fruit.apple` pattern) takes entry children as dotted members (a header would be
spec-illegal while dotted definitions remain), accepts sub-table sections, and `e`-consolidates to
scope form. The headerless-ancestor rule (`is_headerless_table`) replaces the old `Format::Dotted`
checks for prefix strip/add. Moving a **`[T/S]` scope table into another
scope nests it** — every header in the moved section is re-prefixed with the destination path
(`prefix_section_headers`: `[a]`/`[a.sub]` into `[b]` → `[b.a]`/`[b.a.sub]`; capture is
scope-relative via `strip_section_header_prefix`, so a nested `[a.sub]` cut into `[b]` becomes
`[b.sub]`); a `[T/D]` table into an
inline table flattens its members to inline dotted keys. **Illegal table moves report `Illegal`**: a
`[table]` section into an inline table or nested under a *pure* `[T/D]` dotted table (both checked
in `insert`).
Dotted *headers* (`[x.a]` with no `[x]`) still
project as a real nested `Scope` branch. `ScalarType` and a node's
**Format** (writing style) are derived read-only during projection and are orthogonal to each other.
Format covers scalars (hex/oct/bin, basic/literal/multiline string — from the token's syntax kind via
`scalar_kind` — plus `Inf`/`Nan` floats, told apart by token text) *and containers*: an array
is `Inline` or `Multiline`, an inline table `Inline`, a `[table]` scope `Scope`, a dotted-key table
`Dotted`; Root, AoT groups/entries, comments, bools, datetimes and plain floats stay `Plain`. Each node also
carries a **`KeySign`** facet (`Bare | Quoted | Dotted | None`) describing how its own key is
written — `None` for keyless nodes (array elements, comments, AoT entries, Root); taplo lexes
quoted keys as `IDENT` tokens that keep their quotes, so the sign is derived from the token
text. Single-line arrays and inline tables still carry their one-line source repr in `value`
(a multiline array leaves it `None`) — this drives both the VALUE column and the
inline-editability rule below. Golden tests in `cst_project.rs` freeze the projected shape
(snapshotted at toml_edit parity when the legacy backend was retired; regenerated when `sign=`
and container formats landed). The **KIND column** (formerly TYPE/FORMAT; takes 40% of the
terminal width for NAME, kind at the 2/5 mark, value the remainder) renders these facets as a
**fixed-pitch 12-column tag** (`type_tag` in `app.rs`: key sign `(B)/(Q)/(D)/(-)` + type slot
`[T/S]`, `[A/I]`, `[S:str ]`, …); the detail popup keeps word labels, and `node_type_label`
still drives the inline editor's type-change comparison.

**Editing.** `e` dispatches via `edit_target_kind`. **Inline** (`Mode::Edit`): a single-line
scalar that `Replace` can address — keyed under a Table/Root/inline table with **no `Array`
ancestor** (an AoT ancestor is fine: `product[0].sku` works; `x = [{ a = 1 }]` does not), or an
array element on a `Key+ Index*` path (incl. array-of-arrays) — a single-line array/inline table
(edited as its one-line repr), and a single-line comment (raw `#` text, routed to `EditComment`).
**`$EDITOR`**: everything else — multiline strings/arrays, merged multi-line comments, tables,
AoT entries, the Root, and any `E`. The inline editor edits one field at a time: **`Tab` toggles
between Value (default) and Name**; committing a changed Name applies `Mutation::Rename` first,
then the value `Replace` (Tab is disabled for array elements and comments, which have no key).
Commit detects a **type change** by parsing `key = value` with taplo and projecting it
(`node_type_label`), prompting y/n when the label differs. Both columns share one
horizontal-scroll/overflow treatment (`edit_field_spans`, also reused to render the `/` filter
input); editor and filter input are caret-based fields (`←/→/Home/End` move the caret,
`Backspace`/`Del` erase before/at it). The `←/→` **value nudge** re-applies underscore digit
grouping when the original had it. `edit_node` truncates the path only at the first `Index`
whose container is a real `Array` (editing the whole array there); AoT-entry indices and the
keys below them are kept and addressed directly. A `$EDITOR` fragment starts at the node's own
header/value line — an adjacent standalone comment is an independent node and is never part of
the fragment. TOML has no null, so there is no clear-value operation; `a` seeds a new node with
the empty string `""` — a key/value under a Table/Root, or a bare element when the target is an
array.

**Kind switch (`K`).** `Mutation::ConvertKind { path, target: KindTarget }` (`convert_kind` in
`cst_edit.rs`) rewrites a node's kind/notation in place; the TUI side is `Mode::KindSwitch` —
`open_kind_switch` builds the per-node option list (current kind excluded), a small single-select
popup applies on Enter (`k` remains vim cursor-up, so the binding is capital `K`). **Scalars switch
between notations of their own type**, never across types: strings between
basic/literal/multiline/multiline-literal (content decoded then re-encoded; a `'` in a literal
form, `'''` in a multiline literal, or a real newline in a single-line literal is `Illegal` —
single-line *basic* escapes newlines as `\n`, so mstr→str is lossless), integers between
dec/hex/oct/bin radices (`_` separators parse; negatives have no prefixed form), floats between
plain ↔ exponent (exponent detected from the value text — `Format` has no variant for it; re-rendered
from the parsed `f64`); bools, datetimes and `inf`/`nan` have one notation and don't convert.
Arrays toggle inline ↔ multiline
(collapse rejects comments / multi-line elements); tables convert between `[T/I]`/`[T/D]`/`[T/S]`
with `[T/S]` targets checked against the D5 capture rule (mid-entry `[t]`, or a section preceded by
a foreign header, is `Illegal`; a nested `[s.t]` converts relative to its parent's capture) and
inline targets rejecting held comments. **`[A/T]` ↔ arrays**: a group converts to an
inline/multiline array of inline tables (`convert_aot_to_array`: contiguous span, plain
single-line entry bodies only — no sub-sections/comments — and the replacement `key = […]` entry
must not be captured by a foreign preceding header), and a keyed flat-ROOT array whose elements
are **all inline tables** converts to an `[[…]]` group (`convert_array_to_aot`,
`KindTarget::ArrayOfTables`; rejected when an entry follows before the next header — the
sections would capture it). AoT entries, Root and comments don't convert.

**Comments are first-class nodes.** A standalone comment line is a real node in document order —
navigable, selectable, movable, deletable like any other Node; *moving or copying another node
never drags a comment along*, and there is no decor-sweep machinery. Consecutive `#` lines
project as a *single* multi-line Comment node (a blank or non-`#` line breaks the group). A
comment node carries its text as its `value`, so the VALUE column and detail popup show it;
multi-line cell values (merged comments, multiline strings) are collapsed to a one-line preview
(first line + ` …`) by `cell_preview` in `ui.rs`. An end-of-line comment on a value is **not** a
node — it is that node's `trailing_comment` decoration and travels with it. `e` on a
**single-line** comment edits inline (`Mode::Edit` with `is_comment`: the raw `#`-prefixed text
is the sole field — no name, `Tab` is a no-op — and `edit_commit` routes to
`Mutation::EditComment`, staying in the editor on a non-`#` validation error); `E`, a merged
multi-line comment, or one with an `Array` ancestor open `$EDITOR` with the raw text. Deleting a
comment (`d`) is a plain token removal at its `Seg::Index` slot.

**Navigation.** Expand/collapse state is an `App.expanded: HashSet<Path>` of open branch paths. The
**root/file node has the empty path** and is collapsible like any branch — `flatten` treats it
uniformly; the App seeds `[]` into `expanded` so it starts open, and `collapse_all` (`0`) re-inserts
`[]` so it keeps the file node open (only an explicit toggle on the root row hides everything).
Beyond the all-at-once `9`/`0`, **`1`/`2` work one level at a time**: `expand_level` (`1`) inserts
the shallowest not-yet-expanded depth of the cursor branch's subtree per press; `collapse_level`
(`2`) collapses an open branch in place, else moves the cursor up to its parent branch and collapses
that (repeated presses ascend). Both re-find the cursor by path after `rebuild_rows`.

**Filter.** `/` is a three-state flow: `Mode::Filter` (the inline `/` input field) → **Enter** →
`Mode::FilterResults` (browse/select/edit the locked-in filtered list, status shows `[filter: …]`),
or **Esc** clears the filter back to `Mode::Normal`. `App.last_filter` remembers the last committed
query so `/` (`enter_filter`) prefills it and re-applies the live filter. `FilterResults` reuses the
Normal key dispatch (no early-return block); its only differences are mode-aware `escape`
(`exit_filter_results`, keeps `last_filter`) and `/` (`enter_filter`, to refine). Esc peels **one**
filter layer (`exit_filter_results`; the text layer when only `/` is active) — `last_filter` is pure
memory, never a persisted filter. The fuzzy query
matches a node's **key/path** plus a **Comment node's own text** (`recompute_filter` builds the haystack
from the path's `Seg::Key` segments — positional nodes contribute none — and appends the comment text
for a Comment node); a scalar's **value is never matched** — this keeps a loose query from fuzzily hitting unrelated
values while leaving comments searchable as standalone nodes. While a filter is active the matched chars are
highlighted in the **NAME cell** (`search::fuzzy_indices` → `ui::highlight_spans`; gated on a non-empty
query, not the mode, so the highlight survives an inline edit / detail popup; a Comment node's NAME
shows its text, so its match highlights there too). Transient overlays (detail popup,
inline editor) close back into the filtered selection via `App::resting_mode` (`FilterResults` when
`filtered_paths.is_some()`, else `Normal`) — `exit_detail`/`edit_cancel`/`edit_commit` use it.

**Type filter.** `f` opens `Mode::TypeFilter`, a modal checkbox popup (`tui/type_filter.rs`) that
filters by a node's **type facets** — the same `KeySign`/`NodeKind`/`Format` the KIND column shows.
`TypeToken` enumerates one leaf atom per KIND slot and `classify(kind, format)` is the arm-for-arm
inverse of `type_tag` (so popup and column can't drift). The popup has two halves — **key sign**
(`(B)/(Q)/(D)/(-)`) and **type** (root/comment + array/table/string/integer/float/bool/date groups,
`[A/T]` grouped under tables) — each multi-format group carrying an **`all`** quick-toggle row that
is **tristate** (`group_state`: `[x]` all / `[~]` some / `[ ]` none; Space selects-or-clears the
whole group). `TypeFilter::matches` ANDs the two halves and unions within each; an empty half is no
constraint (`is_active` gates the whole filter). `layout()` is the single source of truth for both
render and nav; `nav_rows()` drops headers so the `(row,col)` cursor only lands on cells. The popup
filters **live** (every `type_filter_toggle` recomputes), Enter (`commit_type_filter`) closes into
`resting_mode`, Esc (`exit_type_filter`) clears the type selections. `recompute_filter` now builds
`filtered_paths` as the **AND intersection** of the `/` text match and the type match (matched nodes
keep ancestors). When both filters are active, Esc in `FilterResults` peels **one layer at a time**
via `App.last_filter_applied: Option<FilterLayer>` (most-recently-applied first); the status bar
shows `[filter: …]` and/or `[type: N]`.

**Multi-select.** `Selection` holds `committed` (finalized rows + `s` toggles) and an in-progress
`round` (`anchor..=cursor`); the live set is their union. A Shift+Arrow run extends `round`; the next
Shift+Arrow after any non-shift key (tracked by `App.last_action_was_shift_select`, reset in the event
loop) starts a fresh round, folding the old one into `committed` — so runs union (separate or
overlapping) rather than re-extending the first anchor.

**Clipboard / paste mode.** `copy_selected` (`c`) and `cut_selected` (`x`) load `App.clipboard`
(`Option<Clipboard>`) from `selected_paths()` (the selection, or the cursor row when none). Both
capture **scope-relative** fragments: a node copied/cut out of a `[T/D]` table drops its leading
dotted-ancestor key segments (`serialize_fragment_relative` for copy; `Mutation::Move` strips at
capture for cut — `dotted_ancestor_prefix_len` + `strip_key_prefix`), so `dotted.test.bool_true`
becomes `bool_true` and a paste re-prefixes only for the **destination** (`prefix_entry_key`) instead
of stacking the source prefix. (The `$EDITOR` block edit still uses the full-key `serialize_fragment`.)
Cut defers deletion until a successful paste. A loaded clipboard *is* "paste mode" and is kept distinct from
selection mode: while `clipboard.is_some()`, the three selection mutators (`toggle_select`,
`extend_select_up`/`down`) early-return, so selection is frozen; pressing `c`/`x` again **toggles** the
existing clipboard's mode (copy ↔ cut) instead of re-capturing. Render cues (`draw_tree`): cursor row
green (paste-ready), source rows blue, selected rows grey — and since selection is frozen during paste
mode, blue vs grey never collide. `Esc` in `Mode::Normal` peels one layer per press: clipboard first
(keeping any live selection, status "clipboard cleared"), then selection. Paste (`v`) resolves the
insertion `Target` with `resolve_target` over `true_sibling_index` (position in the *full* tree, so
FilterResults' hidden siblings don't skew it — the same helper is used by `add_node` and the
collision-retry path). `do_paste` pairs each fragment with its source path and splits **node** vs
**comment** entries (identified by `NodeKind::Comment`, not by the path). Nodes: **cut** routes
through the atomic `Mutation::Move` (delete-before-reinsert on a scratch tree, committed only on
success) so a same-scope reposition is a move, not a `Key already exists` collision; **copy** uses the
per-fragment `Mutation::Insert` loop. **Moving or copying an array element out** is supported: into
another array it stays a bare element; into a table/root/`[A/T]` an **inline table** (`{ k = v, … }`)
unpacks into its member entries (`unpack_inline_table` — the inverse of `wrap_keyed_as_inline_element`;
each entry per-leaf collision-checked; the copy path unpacks in `insert` right after
`parse_fragment_adapted`, matching the cut path in `move_nodes`), while a bare value gets a
synthesized `placeholder` key, then `insert`
applies the destination format (dotted prefix, …). Dually, **multiple keyed nodes pasted into an
array or `[A/T]` group are joined** (`joinable_entry`, in `move_nodes` for cut and `do_paste` for
copy) and pack into ONE `{ a = 1, b = 2 }` element / `[[…]]` entry; a multi-entry fragment into an
array packs the same way via `wrap_keyed_as_inline_element`. Comments: a Comment node's fragment is its raw `# …` text, pasted
via `Mutation::InsertComment` (validates every line starts with `#`, splices the block in at the target
child index, never collides); a cut deletes the source comment first, then inserts. A comment into a
**single-line array** is no longer rejected: `InsertComment` upgrades the array to multiline (one
element per line, exact element reprs kept) and then inserts — the TUI asks first via
`Mode::Prompt(ArrayUpgrade)` (`y` re-issues `do_paste` with the upgrade allowed, `n` cancels keeping
the clipboard); the inverse collapse back to inline is deliberately not built. `do_paste` takes the
`Clipboard` by value and **restores it on every failure** (collision → `Mode::Prompt(Collision)` with
the remaining entries — comment entries are preserved so they run on retry; any other error → restores
the rest + `paste error: …`), so a failed paste is never destructive; only `Esc`/`c` at the collision
prompt discards it. Because comments are independent nodes, a moved or copied node never carries an
upper-adjacent comment with it — the comment simply stays where it is.

## Terminology

See **`CONTEXT.md`** for the canonical glossary. Key rule: use **Node** (not "Entry"). Subtypes
are **Root**, **Branch node**, **Leaf node**, **Scalar**, and **Comment**. The operation that
toggles a live Node to/from a Comment is **Remark** (key `r`).
